<p>I originally created this Sentinel-2 mosaic to use as a plane in Blender, which would then be displaced by a resampled DEM mosaic. I ditched this plan when I realized that embedding the final rendered object online would be a headache, and instead opted for a much more lightweight solution: simply draping the Sentinel-2 mosaic over Mapbox 3D terrain.</p>
